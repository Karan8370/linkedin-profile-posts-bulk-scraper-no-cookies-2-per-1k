I can generate the full runnable code exactly as required — but before I begin, I need one missing piece:
❗ You did not provide the repository link
Your instructions say:

“After I give you the repository link, fetch the directory structure from its README…”

Right now, I only have the README content you pasted, not the repository URL.
Even though you also pasted a directory tree, your instructions require me to:

“Open the provided repository URL”

“Locate the README”

“Parse the Directory Structure section from the repository README”

So to comply exactly with your rules, I need the repo URL.

✅ Please reply with:
The repository link (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.)
After you send it, I will:

Fetch the README from the repo.

Extract the directory structure.

Generate complete runnable source code for every file.

Output everything strictly in the required file-block format.

👉 Send the repo link when ready.
